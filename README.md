## 🎨 Customization

### Theme Configuration

Modify the app theme by editing [main.dart](lib/main.dart):

```dart
const Color _primaryColor = Color(0xFFC6302C);      // Main brand color
const Color _darkRedColor = Color(0xFF9A0000);      // Accent color
const String _appTitle = 'OpenPDF Tools';           // App display name
const String _appVersion = '1.0.0';                 // Version string
```

### Adding New Tools

To add a new PDF tool to the application:

1. **Create Screen**: Add a new file in `lib/screens/` (e.g., `my_tool_screen.dart`)
2. **Implement Logic**: Build your tool's functionality using Flutter widgets
3. **Add Route**: Register the route in `HomeScreen`
4. **Add Card**: Create a `_ToolCard` widget in the home grid
5. **Test**: Build and test the new feature

Example:
```dart
// In home_screen.dart
_ToolCard(
  title: 'My New Tool',
  icon: Icons.build,
  onTap: () => Navigator.push(...),
)
```

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

### Android Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:

```xml
<!-- Reading files -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_ALL" />

<!-- Writing converted/compressed files -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

**Why these permissions?**
- Files must be read from device storage to process PDFs
- Conversion and compression results must be saved to accessible locations
- Android prompts users to grant these at runtime (Scoped Storage)

### iOS Permissions

The app requires:
- **Photo Library Access** - For image selection during PDF creation
- **File System Access** - For document handling (requested via `Info.plist`)

### Security Best Practices

✅ Implemented in OpenPDF Tools:
- All file I/O operations wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Proper resource cleanup on app lifecycle events
- Secure temporary file handling with automatic deletion
- Input validation on all file paths
- Error logging for debugging (without exposing sensitive data)

---

## 📱 UI Design

### Responsive Layouts
- **Mobile**: 2-column grid optimized for touch
- **Tablet**: 3+ columns with flexible spacing
- **Desktop**: Full-width responsive adaptation

### Design System
- **Framework**: Material Design 2
- **Primary Color**: #C6302C (Professional Red)
- **Accent**: #9A0000 (Deep Red)
- **Font**: System default for platform
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML/Material components
- Touch target size: 48x48 dp minimum
- High contrast mode support
- Screen reader compatible

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### ❌ File Picker Not Working (Android)
```bash
# Solution: Ensure dependencies and permissions are properly set up
flutter pub get
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
**Fix**: Also check that `AndroidManifest.xml` includes storage permissions.

#### ❌ PDF Viewer Crashes
```bash
# Solution: Update the Syncfusion package
flutter pub upgrade syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer
flutter clean
flutter run
```
**Note**: Syncfusion PdfViewer requires specific permissions on newer Android versions.

#### ❌ Image Compression Failing
```bash
# Solution: Verify system resources
- Check available disk space: At least 500MB free
- Check RAM usage: Close background apps
- Check file permissions: Ensure write access to temp directory
```
**Debug**: Check `flutter logs` for detailed error messages.

#### ❌ "Path not found" on File Operations
- **Android 10+**: Ensure you're using `getExternalFilesDir()` instead of direct paths
- **iOS**: Check `Info.plist` for required document access permissions

#### ❌ Sharing Not Working (Android)
```bash
# Solution: Verify FileProvider is configured
# Check android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml for:
<provider android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider" ... />
```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:
```bash
flutter run -v
# or
flutter logs
```

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how to get involved:

### Development Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AHS-Mobile-Labs/openpdf_tools.git
   cd openpdf_tools
   ```
3. **Create** a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```
4. **Commit** your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'
   ```
5. **Push** to your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```
6. **Open** a Pull Request with a clear description

### Code Guidelines

Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) conventions:

- ✅ Use meaningful names: `getUserFiles()` not `getUF()`
- ✅ Document public APIs: Add dartdoc comments
- ✅ Format code: `dart format lib/`
- ✅ Analyze code: `flutter analyze` (must pass)
- ✅ Write tests: Add tests for new features

Example:
```dart
/// Compresses a PDF file and returns the compressed file path.
/// 
/// [inputPath] must be a valid PDF file path.
/// [quality] should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
Future<String> compressPdf(String inputPath, {double quality = 0.8}) async {
  // Implementation...
}
```

### Testing

Before submitting, run the test suite:
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/widget_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```
